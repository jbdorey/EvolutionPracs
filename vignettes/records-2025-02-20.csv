The butterfly was found deceased on the floor, and the body was in a bad shape, however, the wing pattern and its distinct green colour (photo taken with additional lights, appears to be more blueish) and a greyed out transparent patch as shown in the photo makes it identifiable as a rather rare species. Despite the damage of wings, the estimate of wingspan is about 7 cm. Location is within a highly moist rainforest with dense canopy and running creeks. Time was late night.
