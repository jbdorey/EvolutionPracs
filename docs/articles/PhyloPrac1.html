      This practical class should not be particularly onerous. Today is
      mostly focussed on giving you a very brief overview of what is to
      come in this practical series and to get you thinking about what
      you might like to do for your Grant Proposal assignment.<br>
      R is a very useful programming language that’s open access and
      widely used in science. We don’t expect you to become a master by
      the end of this topic or to understand everything that you’re
      doing right now. But, by helping you get started and giving you
      robust example code we hope to enable you to succeed using R in
      the future, should you chose to pick it up more consistently.

<p>Practicals will be run as the below practical schedule from the
course handbook. Following this practical, we will have:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Four weeks of the <em>Phylogenetics Module</em>. The first three
weeks will be focused on teaching you phylogenetics in the <em>R</em>
programming language and the fourth will be aimed at providing support
for your <strong>Grant Proposal</strong> assignment.</li>
<li>We will have four weeks of the <em>Conservation Behaviour
Module</em>. This module will focus on teaching you about human-wildlife
conflicts and supporting you in your <strong>Elevator Pitch</strong>
assignment.</li>
<li>In weeks <strong>7</strong> and <strong>13</strong>, instead of a
prac, we will have in-class quizzes, each worth 20% of your final grade
and base on the lectures delivered previously.</li>
<li>In weeks <strong>11</strong> and <strong>12</strong>, you will
deliver your seminars to the class, instead of undertaking a standard
practical.</li>

</h2>
<p>You won’t be forming groups <em>per se</em>, but it is possible to
work together on benches to provide your neighbours help with code and
the like. I do encourage this as your neighbour may have already
overcome errors that you have come across and both the student helping
and the one receiving help should benefit! Of course, we will be here to
help you as well; your demonstrators should have the answers and, if
not, your lecturers will.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">3</span> Start thinking about a
macroevolutionary question<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#start-thinking-about-a-macroevolutionary-question"></a>
</h2>
<p>“Macroevolutionary questions” may sound like an arcane concept.
However, they are really just questions that we ask with the goal of
uncovering broad scale (almost always across multiple species)
evolutionary patterns. Maybe that doesn’t help… But, a simple question
like “<em>I wonder how many bird species have purple feathers</em>”
could easily be addressed as a macroevolutionary question! But, that
might be too broad of a question…</p>
<p>Because I work on bees, I might have a question about a particular
bee subgenus. Say the halictid (from the family Halictidae) bee subgenus
<em>Lasioglossum (Homalictus)</em>. I might come up with a hypothesis
such as “<em>More bees in the subgenus</em> Homalictus <em>are metalic
in colouration than non-metalic</em>”. That’s a simple enough question
and I suspect that it’s true… but these bees are found all over the
place (Australia to Southern China and India)! Maybe I could narrow it
down to a place where there are fewer species and lots of genetic data
available. I happen to work on the Fijian <em>Homalictus</em>, so I
could hypothesise that “<em>More FIJIAN bees in the subgenus</em>
Homalictus <em>have metallic abdomens than non-metallic abdomens</em>” —
a question about the prevalence of a state. The data to answer this
question could be derived from <a href="https://uowmailedu-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/jdorey_uow_edu_au/EY-bgdariG1BmtpnuPjMHagBMtcrx9BQaxgHqgpl2bo5Aw?e=BFcQVj" class="external-link">here</a>.
You could also hypothesise that “<em>Homalictus</em> bees are more
likely to move from having metallic abdomens to non-metallic abdomens
than the other way around” — a question about how frequently states
evolve and their direction.</p>
<div class="float">

(Homalictus)</em> (Hymenoptera: Halictidae) bees by James Dorey</div>
</div>
<p>You get the idea. Now we are talking in terms of macroevolution.</p>
<p>You might have a question that you want to answer, or you might have
a group that you are interested in. But, you need to choose a taxon that
is big enough (say &gt;7 species) and limit yourself to a subset of
those species (&lt;30) for which both genetic data and trait data either
exist or can easily be harvested. You could start by searching in
<strong>Google Scholar</strong>, or <strong>Scopus</strong>, for
something like “<em>macroevolution bears</em>”. Then you can see what
genetic data are available and what morphological data are available.
While you can use those same data for your assignment, you <strong>must
ask a novel question using those data or a subset of those
data</strong>.</p>
<p>Talk among your table or with your desk mate and with your
demonstrators. You don’t need to have a project set in stone by any
means, but it’s good to get started on thinking about this and what you
might be able to do!</p>

</h2>
<p>Your computers should already have <em>R</em> and <em>RStudio</em>
installed. If they do not, or you are using a personal computer, feel
free to follow the steps below to prepare yourself for the week 2
practicals, where we will dive in pretty quickly.</p>
<p>If you have a moment of spare time you may consider skimming the
below text, especially the “Script preparation” and “What’s coming next
week” sections.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Install
<em>R</em><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#install-r"></a>
</h3>
<p>If <em>R</em> is NOT installed on your computer already, we will go
ahead and do that now. Please visit the <a href="https://cran.csiro.au" class="external-link"><strong>CSIRO mirror for CRAN</strong></a>
and download the relevant version of <em>R</em> for your operating
system. Then, follow the instructions to install it on your
computer.</p>

<h3 id="install-rstudio">
<span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Install
<em>RStudio</em><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#install-rstudio"></a>
</h3>
<p><em>R</em> is a command-land programming language and <em>R</em>, by
itself is horribly ugly and I don’t like the idea of working in it
directly. For this reason, most users will use R within a much nicer
interface program, called <em>RStudio</em>. Download the free version of
<a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/" class="external-link">RSTudio</a>. Now,
when both programs are installed, you can simply open up RStudio and get
coding!</p>
<p>We are not going to do much with <em>R</em> today, don’t worry, but
I’d like to get you a little acquainted and at least start installing
some packages in <em>R</em> so that we are ready for the following
weeks.</p>

</h3>
<p>Before we get into working in <em>RStudio</em>, let’s make a folder
where we will save all of our practical outputs and related files. Mine
is called “<em>BIOL365_pracs_2024</em>”. Notice how I have used
underscores instead of spaces? This is very good practice to not have
ANY spaces in your folder paths where you want to do coding stuff. Most
of the time it’s fine… but, <strong>pro tip</strong>, sometimes, it will
cause problems that might be hard to track down!</p>
<p>When you open up <em>RStudio</em> for the first time, it will look a
little something like the below (Fig. 2). But, without the funky colour
scheme.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="Media_P1_BIOL365/Rsession1.png" width="600" alt="An empty RStudio page"><div class="figcaption">An empty <em>RStudio</em> page</div>
</div>
<p>In the top left-hand side drop down, there is a white page with a
green plus sign on it. Click on that and you can then select to add a
new “R Script” (Fig. 3). We can then go ahead and save this blank script
in a folder for these pracs (Fig. 4). I have called this script
“<em>MyFirstRScript.R</em>”.</p>

</div>
<p>It’s also VERY good practice to leave some info about who made this
script, why, and how they can get in touch with you! Go ahead and copy
the below into your script and then personalise it with your
details!</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>Did you notice all of the hashtags? These are comments and <em>R</em>
will ignore them (Fig. 5)!</p>
<div class="float">

<h4 id="working-directory">
<span class="header-section-number">4.4.1</span> Working
directory<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#working-directory"></a>
</h4>
<p>Let us begin by telling <em>R</em> where our working directory (the
folder that you made above) actually is. My
“<em>BIOL365_pracs_2024</em>” folder is found at the end of the
path:</p>
<p>“<em>/Users/jamesdorey/Desktop/Uni/Teaching/BIOL365_971/BIOL365_pracs_2024/Prac1/</em>”
(see again, no spaces!). So, I can run the below:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span>  <span class="co"># Set the RootPath to your folder</span></span>
<span><span class="va">RootPath</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="st">"/Users/jamesdorey/Desktop/Uni/Teaching/BIOL365_971/BIOL365_pracs_2024/Prac1/BIOL365_pracs_2024"</span></span>
<span>  <span class="co"># You can then set this as the project's working directory. </span></span>
<span>  <span class="co"># This is where R will first look to find </span></span>
<span>  <span class="co"># or save data as a default</span></span>
<span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/getwd.html" class="external-link">setwd</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">RootPath</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Congratulations, you have set your working directory! <em>R</em> can
still access files outside of this folder, but it will look there by
default after you set it (this must be set each time you open
<em>R</em>).</p>
<p><strong>A quick pro-tip:</strong> You can run code, once it’s entered
into your script by having your mouse click on, or above, the line that
you want to run and then pressing the “<strong>Run</strong>” button on
the top right hand side of the script window. That’s a right pain. On
mac you can simply use “<strong>command+enter</strong>” and on PC you
can use “<strong>control+enter</strong>” to run your code. It’ll make
you life easier and quicker.</p>

<div class="section level4" number="4.4.2">
<h4 id="install-packages">
<span class="header-section-number">4.4.2</span> Install
packages<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#install-packages"></a>
</h4>
<p>Let us also quickly install a few packages that we’ll need to start
with next week (you mostly only need to do this once per package and per
version of <em>R</em>).</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co">#  This package is for data management and table manipulation</span></span>
<span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html" class="external-link">install.packages</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"dplyr"</span><span class="op">)</span></span>

<p>You may have seen that more than one package was installed when you
ran the above code. That’s normal, many packages depend on other
packages to work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4" number="4.4.3">
<h4 id="load-packages">
<span class="header-section-number">4.4.3</span> Load packages<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#load-packages"></a>
</h4>
<p>The last <em>R</em> thing that I will get you to do today is to load
the packages into <em>R</em> (this also should be done every time you
open <em>R</em>, for the relevant packages). You need to do this because
you may not always want EVERY package that you have ever downloaded to
be accessible from in <em>R</em>… it can cause issues. In this way, you
can be more selective about which ones are active.</p>
